# JSONtoCOOL

What is this?
-------------
Basic python based script to generate a (local) COOL database from a neural net stored in a JSON file using the same conventions as required by Dan's lightweight neural network client which is then to be used in a local test run using the flavour tagging performance framework.


How do I use it?
----------------
Run `./JSONtoCOOL <base root file> <json file to add>`.

For more info, run the converter with no arguments (**do NOT source
this script**)

```
./JSONtoCOOL
```

This will print help. Follow the instructions.
